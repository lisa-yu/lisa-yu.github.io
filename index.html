        At school, I have held the corporate officer and technical officer positions of UT Women in Computer Science (WiCS), 
        as well as the corporate VP position for the UT chapter of Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). I helped
        organize three hackathons - WiCS Hacks 2018 & 2019 as well as HackTX 2018 as a Freetail Hackers logistics organizer.

      <p>I am most drawn towards full-stack development and being involved in multiple layers of a product. 
        I am passionate about helping more women involved in technology and getting involved in diversity initiatives. 
        Thanks for visiting my page!
